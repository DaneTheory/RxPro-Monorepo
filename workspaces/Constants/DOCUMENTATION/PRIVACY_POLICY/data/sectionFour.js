      Log files are pieces of information that let us know how people are accessing PrecisionRx websites.
      Each time you go to a page in our websites, our server shows this page on your computer. When the
      page displays, we create a log file that tells us that someone visited the page. We do not collect
      any personally identifiable information about you in the log files. PrecisionRx uses log files to
      create aggregate reports of site activity. This means we take the information about our visitors
      and add it together to report on all pages of the site visited. We do share the reports of aggregate
      usage of our sites with our customers. In order to service you, if you sign-in to a PrecisionRx
      secure website, PrecisionRx may collect, track, and securely transmit certain website data and
      activity to PrecisionRxâ€™ s back office systems, in order to allow you to securely access your
      personally-identifiable information.
