        Please note that individualized information transmitted via email correspondence between you and
        PrecisionRx — as opposed to transmission over PrecisionRx’ s website — is not encrypted. As a
        result, like most, if not all, non-encrypted Internet email communications, such email
        correspondence may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge and
        permission while in transit. For that reason, to protect your privacy, if you have concerns about
        treatment, or questions that would involve the communication of confidential/personal health
        information, please call your physician or other healthcare professional, or plan representative
        provided in your plan “Welcome Package” (or supervisor where applicable). All users of secure
        sign-in websites are required to use a user ID and password to further protect privacy.
        It is very important not to share with or give your user ID or password to anyone and give
        thought to any person(s) who may have access to your account.

        Where sign-in is required to access a website, email addresses are collected as part of the
        registration process for the website. Email addresses are used to notify users of online
        activity related to the security and privacy of their accounts, such as requests to change
        a password or requests to change an address. These email communications are necessary to
        protect the privacy and security of your account. PrecisionRx does not sell, rent, lease,
        or give away user email addresses. PrecisionRx does not share your email information with
        third parties other than for providing service to you.
